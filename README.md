### NBA statistics for role classification.

This project aims at implementing the basic theoretical concepts behind the MapReduce distributed computing paradigm, and Hadoop in particular, and at building expertise in the practical usage of high-performance computing tools for data engineering, analysis and mining. Classical data mining algorithms are applied to Big Data using Hadoop (Spark).
